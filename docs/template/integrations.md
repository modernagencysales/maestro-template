# Integrations

Integrations are Effect services with fake, test, and live layers. The template
must run without live credentials. Adapter boundaries live in
`packages/integrations/src/index.ts` and return Effect programs with typed,
public-safe provider errors.

## Default Families

- `LlmGateway`
- `PolicyResolver`
- `Flags`
- `Billing`
- `Analytics`
- `ErrorReporter`
- `Email`
- `Notifications`
- `Storage`
- `Search`
- `Jobs`
- `Connectors`
- `Documents`
- `Operations`

## Concrete Adapter Targets

- WorkOS/AuthKit for auth and organizations.
- PostHog for analytics.
- Dodo for billing.
- MailerSend for email.
- OpenRouter-compatible LLM provider through an OpenAI-compatible client
  surface.

Resend, Sentry, Slack/webhooks, CRM, drive, and Notion connectors are optional
adapters.

## PostHog Backend Event Capture

PostHog backend capture covers Confect mutation and action failures only. Wrap
Effect programs with `withMutationErrorCapture(functionPath, effect)` or
`withActionErrorCapture(functionPath, effect)` so failed effects emit the
`template.confect.failure` event before the original Effect cause is re-failed.

The event contract is intentionally small and public-safe:

- `functionPath`, such as `brain/pages.createMarkdown`
- `kind`, either `mutation` or `action`
- public error tag
- redacted public message
- stable cause hash
- optional workspace and user identifiers when already available

Capture is best-effort. PostHog delivery errors are dropped by the capture path
and must not replace, mask, or retry the original application failure. Query
capture is not included in this slice because Confect query context does not
provide the scheduler required by the PostHog Convex component.

## Rules

- Decode config through typed config modules.
- Redact provider errors.
- Redact common secret field names for every provider, then apply
  provider-specific redaction.
- Verify webhook signatures and replay windows.
- Keep raw provider payloads out of logs and public errors.
- Add fake-mode smoke tests before live setup.
- Live mode validates required env var names before an adapter can be
  constructed.

## Billing And Dodo

Dodo remains fake-first in the template. Live Dodo calls stay behind
`packages/integrations/src/dodo.ts`, while `packages/convex/confect/ops/billing`
stores the reusable billing state:

- webhook events deduplicate by provider, event ID, and signature timestamp
- usage events carry an entitlement key before they create append-only credit
  ledger entries
- entitlements model seats, credits, and feature limits without hard-coding a
  pricing plan
- seat checks return typed failures instead of silently over-provisioning

Fake billing receipts redact customer and provider metadata. Webhook
normalization also redacts raw payload `data`, so tests and logs can inspect
event identity without leaking customer emails, Dodo customer IDs, checkout
session IDs, or signatures.

## Inspect Readiness

The provider catalog lives in `packages/integrations/src/index.ts`. It declares
fake/test/live posture, required live env var names, redacted fields, adapter
construction, and deterministic fake/test/live-ready receipts for each provider.
Inspect it through:

```bash
pnpm exec tsx apps/cli/src/index.ts integrations report fake
pnpm exec tsx apps/cli/src/index.ts integrations report live
pnpm --dir packages/integrations test
```

Live mode reports missing env var names only; it must not print secret values.
Fake and test modes construct adapters without secrets and return redacted
receipts through the Effect error channel. Live mode is a configured boundary:
client apps replace the deterministic `live-ready` receipts with SDK-backed
provider calls inside the same adapter shape.
